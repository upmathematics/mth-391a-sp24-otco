## How Posit Cloud Works?

```{r posit-cloud-network, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Posit Cloud Computing", fig.align='center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("how-posit-cloud-works.png")
```

## Basic Parts of Posit Cloud

```{r posit-cloud-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic Parts of Posit Cloud", fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("basic-parts-of-posit-cloud.png")
```

## R Studio Working Directory

```{r r-studio-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Working Directory", fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("r-studio-working-directory.png")
```

## Creating an R Script

An R script is a file with an extension ".R". It can contain lines of R commands that you can define and run individual lines or run multiple lines.

```{r r-studio-3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="R Script File Example", fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("r-studio-r-scripting.png")
```

## Running R on the Console vs Scripting

```{r r-studio-4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Running R Commands in Different Ways", fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("r-studio-console-vs-scripting.png")
```

## Mini-Assignment: Create a Simple R Script

1. Go to this course's workspace in Posit Cloud and click the R Studio "Project" named *Mini-Assignment 1: Create a Simple R Script*. This will create a copy for you.

2. Try rerunning the R script named *simple-r-script_example.R*.

3. Create a new R script and save it as *my-simple-r-script.R*. In your script:
    - Write in your name as a comment.
    - Create 5 single line R commands with comments as labels similar to the example.
    
4. Export your R script file, then submit it in Moodle.
