## RMarkdown, an Introduction

**What is RMarkdown?**

:::: {.column width=1%}
::::

:::: {.column width=48%}
* A tool for creating dynamic documents.
* Combines plain text, code, and outputs (e.g., plots, tables).
* RMarkdown is a file with extension ".Rmd", and when executed, it outputs into HTML, PDF, Word, or Slides.
::::

:::: {.column width=48%}
* It support multiple programming languages.
* It was created for the purpose of automating scientific reports and visualizations.
* It is also professional, clean, and organized.

## RMarkdown for Reproducibility

**Why use RMarkdown?**

:::: {.column width=1%}
::::

:::: {.column width=48%}
* **Dynamic and Flexible Document Creation:** Allows easy updates and ideal for iterative research processes.
* **Integration of Code and Results:** Combine R and other programming languages in the same document. Automatically executes and displays code outputs (e.g., tables, plots).
* **Python Equivalent:** Jupyter Notebook is similar to RMarkdown but it is primarily built for Python instead of R. *We will explore more on this later.*
::::

:::: {.column width=48%}
* **Widely Used in Data Science:** Popular in academia, industry, and reporting. Simplifies workflows for analysis, visualization, and documentation.
* **RMarkdown is required for this course's assignments:** All assignments must be completed in RMarkdown and submitted in both `.Rmd` and `.html` formats. *This ensures that your work is detailed, well-organized, and clearly presented.*

## RMarkdown in R Studio

**What does RMarkdown look like in R Studio?**

```{r rmarkdown-view, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RMarkdown Viewed in R Studio", fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown-in-r-studio.png")
```

## Basic Parts of RMarkdown (1/2)

:::: {.column width=60%}
```{r rmarkdown-basic-parts-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RMarkdown Basic Parts 1, 2, & 3", fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown-basic-parts-1.png")
```
::::

:::: {.column width=39%}
1. **The YAML header:** It is placed at the very beginning of the file with start and end syntax "` --- `". This header is required and the information that it contains can affect the entire output.
2. **Levels of Headers:** It provides titles to sections.
3. **Basic Paragraph:** Normal text that you can write where a new line means new paragraph.
::::

## Basic Parts of RMarkdown (2/2)

:::: {.column width=60%}
```{r rmarkdown-basic-parts-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RMarkdown Basic Parts 4 & 5", fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown-basic-parts-2.png")
```
::::

:::: {.column width=39%}
4. **Code Chunks:** The heart of RMarkdown, where you can run codes and present it and its output clearly with the rest of the document. The start and end syntax is "` ``` `".
5. **Blocked Paragraph:** A special paragraph that allows customization, such as changing the text color of its output.

## Code Chunks in RMarkdown

```{r code-chunks-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Creating an R Code Chunk", fig.align='center', out.width = '95%'}

## Running R on RMarkdown vs Knitting

## Expectations on Assignment Deliverables

### **Mini-Assignments**

In-class activities and mini-assignments must be submitted either physically or through Moodle. Depending on the lesson, submission format will be in physical form, `.pdf`, `.Rmd`, or `.html`.

### **Project Phases**

All project phase reports must be submitted in both `.Rmd` and `.html` files through Moodle.

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ Mini-assignments and the Project will have special R Studio spaces.

## Activity: Modify a RMarkdown document

The purpose of this activity is for you to get a sense of how mini-assignments and the project are done.

1. Log-in to Posit Cloud and open the R Studio assignment *Mini-Assignment 2: Modify a RMarkdown Document*.

2. Make sure you are in the current working directory. Rename the `.Rmd` file to your name. Then, open the `.Rmd` file.

3. Change the author in the YAML header.

4. Read the provided instructions. Then answer all problems.

5. Knit your `.Rmd` file to `.html` file. Then, export both of your `.Rmd` and `.html` files and submit them into Moodle.
