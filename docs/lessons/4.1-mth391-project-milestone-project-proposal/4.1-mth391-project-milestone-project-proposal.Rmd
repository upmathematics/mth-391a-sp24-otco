## Objectives

:::: {.column width=15%}
::::

:::: {.column width=70%}
- **Develop an understanding of the project expectations**
- **Know the different choices of project data sets**
- **Choose a data set and start working on project proposals**

## Previously... 

The guiding principle of data science is the data science life cycle.

```{r data-science-life-cycle, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Data Science Life Cycle", fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("data-science-lifecycle.png")
```

## Project Expectations

**Purpose of Project Phases**

* Breaks the semester-long project into manageable tasks
* Ensures incremental progress and structured development

**Presentation Requirements**
  
* *Format:* 3-minute presentation with 3 well-designed slides
* *Focus Areas:*
  
  1. **Tasks:** Define objectives, problem, and targeted outcomes
  2. **Progress Achieved:** Highlight key work completed and challenges addressed
  3. **Next Tasks:** Outline upcoming steps, hurdles, and contingency plans

**Best Practices**

* Use visual aids (charts, graphs, images) for clarity
* Keep content concise and focused
* Maintain professional and engaging delivery

## Project Milstone vs Phase

**Project Phases**

* Represent minor stages in a project.
* Each phase involves specific tasks contributing to the overall project.

**Project Milestones**

* Checkpoints that confirm progress and alignment with objectives.
* Do not involve tasks but indicate completion of a phase or key achievement.

## Project Proposal

**Frame your data science project, establish objectives, and outline the approach to solving it. Requirements:**

* Clearly define the problem or research question.
* Specify the dataset(s) to be used and their relevance.
* Outline the methods or techniques to be employed (e.g., exploratory data analysis, modeling, visualization).
    
**While you think about your proposal, here are key contents that must exist in your overall project:**

* Data wrangling of a main data set and multiple secondary related data sets
* Data visualization of common plots and with at least one of each type such as temporal, spatial, and network plots
* (Optional) Mathematical/Statistical modeling and/or inference

## Activity: Getting Started with your Project

1. Log-in to Posit Cloud and open the R Studio assignment `Project AlexQ`.
2. Replace the project name `Project AlexQ` to your name using the format `Project [First name][Last initial]`.
3. Create a new RMarkdown file and modify it with your name. Remove the default texts.
4. Choose one data set in the given list. In your Rmarkdown file, provide the following information:

    * Define your problem or research question
    * Specify the dataset(s) to be used and their relevance
    * Outline the methods or techniques to be employed

5. When finished, knit your `.Rmd` to `.html`, and create a 3-slide presentation that summarizes your report, then Submit your work to Moodle.
    
::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ Your report (`.Rmd`, `.html`, and the 3-slide presentation) for this milestone will be due on the next milestone of the project. The in-between phases will serve as check-ins.
