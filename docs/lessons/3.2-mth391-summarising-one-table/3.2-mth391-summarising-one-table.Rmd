## Objectives

:::: {.column width=15%}
::::

:::: {.column width=70%}
- **Develop proficiency in summarising one data frame**
- **Introduce a Strategy and best practice on summarising a data frame**

:::: {.column width=49%}
**R Packages:** `tidyverse` is a collection of packages suited for data processing and visualization, which includes `tibble` and `dplyr` packages.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r tidyverse-hex, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("tidyverse.png")
```
::::

:::: {.column width=49%}
**Tibbles:** Tibbles are special kinds of data frames using the `tibble` package in `tidyverse`.

```{r tibble-df-view, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align='center', out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("data-frame-tibble.png")
```
::::

## Previously... (2/2)

**Chaining `dplyr` Verbs Using `|>`**

**Advanced Example:** The goal of this example is to transform the `iris` dataset by computing the ratio of `Petal.Length` to `Sepal.Length` for observations belonging to the "setosa" species.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
tibble(iris) |> 
  # rule 1: choose only the "setosa" species
  filter(Species == "setosa") |> 
  # rule 2: pick the columns Sepal.Length and Petal.Length
  select(Sepal.Length,Petal.Length) |> 
  # rule 3: create a new column called length_ratio
  mutate(length_ratio = Petal.Length/Sepal.Length)
```

## `dplyr` Verbs for Tidying Data {.smaller}

**`dplyr` functions that operates on rows and columns**

| **Verb** | **Purpose** & **Example** |
|:--|:--------|
| `group_by()` | Groups rows by one or more columns, allowing operations to be performed within groups. <br><br>`group_by(data,category)` |
| `summarise()` | Reduces multiple rows into a single summary row per group. <br><br>`summarise(data,new_var = function(var))` |

::: {style="color: red"}
$\star$ The `group_by()` and `summarise()` usually goes together if you need to compute descriptive statistics of each category of a categorical variable.
:::

## Example: Summarising One Table by Group

**Define Data Frame as a Tibble**

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
iris_tibble <- tibble(iris)
```

**Summarising by Nesting Verbs**

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
summarise(group_by(iris_tibble,Species),mean_sepal_length = mean(Sepal.Length))
```

::: {style="color: red"}
$\star$ Here, you are nesting the functions `group_by()` and `summarise()` to compute the mean of the `Sepal.Length` column in each category of the `Species` column.
:::

**Summarising by Piping Verbs**

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
iris_tibble |> 
  # Step 1: group by species
  group_by(Species) |> 
  # Step 2: Calculate the mean of the Sepal.Length column
  #  - mean_sepal_length is the new column for the calculated mean
  summarise(mean_sepal_length = mean(Sepal.Length))
```

::: {style="color: red"}
$\star$ Here, you are using the piping operator `|>`, where you don't need to nest the verbs, and the verbs are written in a logical sequence line-by-line.
:::

## Data Summarization Strategy and Best Practice

**What is a strategy and best practice on summarising a data frame?**

1. Understand your data frame, its variables, the variable types, and how many rows.
2. Know the end goal of the summary such as knowing what computations on numerical (or categorical) variables.
3. Figure out what categorical variables --if any-- you need to group for the summarizations.
4. Vision the ordering of categorical variables on which to group by before summarising.
5. Implement the verbs in code line-by-line, check the output, then make adjustments.

## In-Class Demonstrations

**Case example:** Using the `iris` dataset, we want to compute the mean of each numerical variable for each species and count the number of rows per species.

**Post-summarisation results**

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Summarization sequence
mean_summary <- iris_tibble |> 
  # group the tibble by species
  group_by(Species) |> 
  # summarise data using the mean and number of observations for each species
  summarise(
    N = n(), # count total number of rows
    mean_sepal_length = mean(Sepal.Length), # compute mean of sepal length
    mean_sepal_width = mean(Sepal.Width), # compute mean of sepal width
    mean_petal_length = mean(Petal.Length), # compute mean of petal length
    mean_petal_width = mean(Petal.Width), # compute mean of petal width
  )
# display result
mean_summary
```

::: {style="color: blue"}
$\dagger$ The goal of the demonstration is to replicate the shown result using the `group_by()` and `summarise()` verbs.

## Activity: Summarise Data by Category

The purpose of this activity is for you to start developing a proficiency in summarising a data frame using the `group_by()` and `summarise()` verbs.

1. Log-in to Posit Cloud and open the R Studio assignment *MA4: Summarise Data by Category*.
2. Make sure you are in the current working directory. Rename the `.Rmd` file by replacing `[name]` with your name using the format `[First name][Last initial]`. Then, open the `.Rmd` file.
3. Change the author in the YAML header.
4. Read the provided instructions.
5. Answer all exercise problems on the designated sections.
