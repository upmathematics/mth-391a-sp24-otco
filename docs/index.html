<h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
<p>We will be using Teams as the main real-time communication tool for
general announcements, question-answering discussions, and direct
messages. I added you to the Teams page already, so you just need to log
in using your UP credentials. If not, then send a request when you log
in. Let me know if you need any assistance.</p>
<p>I recommend that you install the Teams software on your own machine
for easy and stable access, instead of accessing Teams on the
browser.</p>

you must use your UP email for me to add you into the course’s workspace
in Posit Cloud. You will receive an email inviting you into the
workspace at the first week of the semester.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>R instructions and materials will be provided ad hoc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the Posit Cloud computing service is free for you but it is
metered by computation hours for the instructor. Please only use the
service for course related computations.</p>
<p>If you are interested in using your own machine, you can install R
environments yourself. First, you need to install <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a>. Next, install
<a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="_blank">R
Studio</a>.</p>

<div id="the-learning-commons" class="section level3">
<h3>The Learning Commons</h3>
<p>You can get academic assistance through Learning Commons tutoring
services and workshops. The Co-Pilot peer tutoring program provides you
with opportunities to work with other students to get help in writing,
math, group projects, and other courses. Schedule an appointment to meet
with a Co-Pilot (tutor) by visiting the <a
href="www.up.edu/learningcommons" target="_blank">Learning Commons</a>
website. You can also meet with a Co-Pilot during drop-in hours. Check
the Learning Commons website or drop by the Learning Commons in BC 163
to learn more about their services. Find a tutor at the Learning Commons
to get support on your academic journey.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div id="help-hours-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Help Hours Guidelines</h3>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or
set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling
behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to
clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive
during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three
recommendations before you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all
concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one
by one.</li>
<li>Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant
materials.</li>
<li>Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you
have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the
strategies you have tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out
of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and
chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for
one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an
appointment.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>I expect you to participate in the class through lectures, class
activities, discussions, homework, and other engagements. I also expect
you to make use of opportunities to get help outside of class (help
hours, Teams, email, tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific
messages are the most helpful so I know how I can best help you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are encouraged to participate in discussions with your peers
regarding assignments. However, each student must take responsibility
and ownership of their work and submit their work individually, except
for group projects.</p>

growth in processing, visualizing, and analyzing complex data sets,
communicating data stories, and making meaningful data-driven
conclusions.</p>
<p>This course uses a standards-based grading system, which emphasizes
mastery of specific learning objectives. This approach is more precise
and motivating than traditional grading methods and fosters a more
equitable learning environment. Key features of standards-based grading
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear focus on mastering defined learning objectives</li>
<li>The use of diverse assessment methods to evaluate understanding</li>
<li>Regular, detailed feedback to guide your progress</li>

</div>
<div id="late-assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Late Assignments</h3>
<p>You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time.
Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time - such
as a medical reason - are understandable. Please let me know if you are
unable to submit your work and have missed the deadline way beyond its
original posted date. Because every assignment is an important aspect of
your learning in this class, we will discuss when you will turn in the
assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable consequence for your
turning it in late. I am committed to successfully helping you learn
from this course.</p>
</div>
<div id="incompletes" class="section level3">
<h3>Incompletes</h3>
<p>An incomplete “I” will only be considered when the quality of a
student’s work is satisfactory (C- or better), but for some essential
reason the course has not been completed by the student. An “I” is
reserved for emergency situations only. To request an incomplete, the
student must submit a typed, signed and dated letter stating the
reason(s) why an incomplete is appropriate. The letter should also
contain the conditions for the completion of work. Acceptance of the
request shall be at the discretion of the instructor, Department Chair,
and/or Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland strives to make its courses and services
fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss
with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to
meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a
disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for
Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic
Resource Center (503-943-8985). <strong>If you have an AES Accommodation
Plan</strong>, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to
implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for
exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two
weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in
advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your
instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to
ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other
emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or
accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for
completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation
standards specified in the course syllabus.</p>
</div>
<div id="code-of-academic-integrity" class="section level3">
<h3>Code of Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a diverse academic community of
learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and
engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such
pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present
truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that
they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s
assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without
proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.</p>
<p>Especially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical
responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or
other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit
assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are
original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines
for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the
specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also
maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at <a
href="libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">https://libguides.up.edu/cite</a>.</p>
<p>The misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated
as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or
cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI
Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider
appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their
courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not
detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All
members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating
sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work,
upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.</p>
<p>Please see the University Bulletin for further information: <a
href="http://up.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2022-2023/bulletin/University-Academic-Regulations/I-Code-of-Academic-Integrity/Guidelines-for-Implementation-of-the-Universitys-Code-of-Academic-Integrity"

<div id="course-ai-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Course AI Policy</h3>
<p>The use of generative AI — such as Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT — is
encouraged and allowed in all of its capacity. However, students must
use these tools ethically and responsibly. To use generative AI
responsibly in this class, students should grasp underlying concepts,
acknowledge AI’s assistance, protect data privacy, verify information,
and uphold academic honor code. AI should be seen as a learning aid, not
a replacement for critical thinking.</p>
</div>
<div id="referencing-and-citation-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Referencing and Citation Guidelines</h3>
<p>In your written work for this course, you must cite all sources of
information that you use, whether they are direct quotes, paraphrases,
or summaries. The style of citation that you use should be consistent
throughout your paper. The citation styles for this course are APA or
CSE.</p>
<ul>
<li>APA style is used in the social sciences and psychology. It is
characterized by parenthetical citations that include the author’s last
name and the year of publication. For example, “According to Smith
(2023), the average height of a man in the United States is 5’10”.”</li>
<li>CSE style is used in the natural sciences and engineering. It is
characterized by numbered citations that are listed at the end of the
paper. For example, “[1] Smith, J. (2023). The average height of a man
in the United States. Journal of Human Biology, 55(2), 123-132.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure which citation style to use, please consult with
me. You can also find more information about APA and CSE style in the
Clark Library citation guidelines: <a
href="https://libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">libguides.up.edu/cite</a></p>
<p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s work without giving
them credit. It is a serious academic offense that can result in a
failing grade or even expulsion from school. By following these
guidelines, you can help to avoid plagiarism and ensure that your work
is properly cited.</p>
</div>
<div id="mental-health-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Mental Health Statement</h3>
<p>Anyone may sometimes experience problems with their mental health
that interfere with academic experiences and negatively impact daily
life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health challenges at
UP, please contact the <a href="https://www.up.edu/counceling/"
target="_blank">University of Portland Counseling Center</a> in the
upper level of Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and near
Mehling Hall) at 503-943-7134 or <a href="mailto:hcc@up.edu"

<h3>Non-Violence Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is committed to fostering a safe and

<h3>Ethics of Information</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the
investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and
encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the
whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and
honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the
right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information,
including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use,
information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found
in the Clark Library’s guide to the Ethical Use of Information at <a

</div>
<div id="diversity-and-inclusion-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Diversity and Inclusion Statement</h3>
<p>In the study of natural and mathematical sciences, often perceived as
objective disciplines aimed at understanding the world, it is crucial to
recognize the historical biases embedded within these fields, stemming
from a limited set of privileged populations. Acknowledging the
potential existence of overt and covert biases within the course, I
emphasize that science is a human endeavor necessitating the
incorporation of diverse experiences in the pursuit of knowledge and
skill. Valuing every student irrespective of background, origin, race,
religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability status, etc., I am
committed to fostering an inclusive climate throughout the course.
Encouraging open communication about concerns or challenges, I assure
